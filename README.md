## Python - Assistan ##

An interactive, beginner‑friendly Python command‑line assistant designed to help users learn, explore, and have fun. This project combines math tools, games, recommendations, jokes, and time utilities into one clean, menu‑driven experience. It’s built to be modular, teachable, and easy to extend.

## Features ##

Project Structure
project-folder/

- main.py              
- assist_.py           
- README.md            
- requirements.txt    


How to Run
- Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
- Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Medard30/Interactive-Assistant.git
- Navigate into the project folder:
cd gold-cli-assistant
- Run the program:
python assist2.py



How It Works
The program starts by asking the user for their name, then displays a clean interactive menu. Each menu option calls a function inside the assist_ module, keeping the code modular and easy to maintain.
This structure makes it ideal for:
- Teaching beginners how to build menu‑driven programs
- Demonstrating modular Python design
- Expanding into a larger personal assistant project
